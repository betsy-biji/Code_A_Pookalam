# Pookalam Design with Python Turtle ðŸŒ¸

This project uses Python's built-in `turtle` graphics library to draw a **Pookalam** â€” the traditional floral rangoli design created during **Onam**, a festival celebrated in Kerala, India.

### âœ¨ Features
- Concentric circles forming the base floral pattern.
- 12 large outer petals divided into 3 colorful bands (yellow, orange, red).
- Decorative brown & green rings for layered floral style.
- Inner yellow band partitioned into 5 sections with mini white circles.
- Pink 4-petal mini flowers placed inside each small circle.
- Central red circle with a **6-petal star flower** (yellow & orange).
- All geometry drawn programmatically (no images, pure math + turtle).
